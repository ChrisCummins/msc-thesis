Figure~\ref{fig:gantt} shows the schedule for this project. In
addition to the Intermediate Progress Presentation in April, I have
created two personal milestones to provide progress checks. The first
milestone corresponds with the end of the exploratory phase of
development. The second milestone is at the end of the implementation
stage. It marks the point at which development of the code base will
freeze so as to enable an extended evaluation. I will use the git
version control system\footnote{\url{http://git-scm.com/}} to track
all source code and experimental data. I will use
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} to track issues and
milestone progress.
