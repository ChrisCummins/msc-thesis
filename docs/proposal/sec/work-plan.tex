The schedule for this project is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gantt}. In
addition to the Intermediate Progress Presentation in April, two
personal milestones will be used to provide ongoing progress
checks. The first milestone corresponds with the end of the
exploratory phase of development. The second milestone is placed at
the end of the implementation stage, marking the point at which the
implementation code base is frozen in order to facilitate the
evaluation. All source code and experimental results will be tracked
using the git version control
system\footnote{\url{http://git-scm.com/}}, and
GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} will be used to track
issues and milestone progress.
