# September 2014

## Friday 12th

### Notes for next supervisor meeting:

 * Weekly (?) meetings with Pavlos
 * Need to know convenient times
 * Logbook / meeting notes:
   * Same as undergrad project: [Markdown log hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisCummins/pip-db/blob/master/Documentation/Log.md)?
 * MSc project
   * LLVM good, GCC bad
   * [Algorithmic Skeletons: Structured Management of Parallel Computation](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomepages.inf.ed.ac.uk%2Fmic%2FPubs%2Fskeletonbook.ps.gz&ei=2f0WVNfmF47saNyigIAN&usg=AFQjCNGcrR6rY75gPqfz7y4Dr_Ztj48_dg&sig2=SNZO8I1r1oor05uXABraUA&bvm=bv.75097201,d.d2s&cad=rja)
     * Extended version of PhD thesis
     * "Increase raw performance by replication as well as by
       miniaturisation"
   * Similarities to HOF in functional languages
   * C++ Templates
     * What advantages over function pointers in C?
   * Compiled languages vs runtimes
     * There are some interesting lesser used languages with features
       that would simplify the task of auto parallelising.
     * E.g. Clojure: "For the concurrent programming future,
       pervasive, unmoderated mutation simply has to go".
     * Supposedly Haskell is even more "pure" and so capable of
       implicit parallelisation.
