  \noindent
  By their nature, Algorithmic Skeletons abstract implement details
  from the user which can be critical to performance. This project
  explores the effect of one such implementation detail --- setting
  the workgroup size of OpenCL kernels --- for SkelCL Stencil
  patterns. Through an exhaustive enumeration of a large optimisation
  space, we find that there is no one sensible default value which
  provides portable performance across the range of architectures,
  kernels, and datasets which SkelCL targets. As a result, we present
  a machine-learning enabled autotuner which performs runtime
  prediction of optimal workgroup sizes, achieving \todo{XXX}\%
  performance of the oracle, providing an average speedup of
  \todo{XXX}$\times$ (max \todo{XXX}$\times$) over the best statically
  chosen value.

\section{Introduction}
GPUs enable massive performance through heterogeneous
parallelism. However, developing software for these devices is
challenging, as the programming models provided by OpenCL and CUDA
require a low level knowledge of the underlying architecture to
properly exploit the potential performance. SkelCL addresses this
programmability challenge by providing high level skeleton patterns
for common data parallel operations. This project demonstrates that
the parameters which are necessarily abstracted by such skeletons can
have a huge impact on performance. To demonstrate this, I present an
autotuner for selecting the \emph{workgroup size} of Stencil pattern
kernels.

\section{Background}

In OpenCL, kernels are mapped to work-items for execution on the
processing units of GPUs and CPUs. These work-items are then grouped
into one or more workgroups. The choice of workgroup size is left to
the developer, but with two sets of constraints. The first set of
constraints is the maximum workgroup size which an execution device
supports. This value cannot be exceeded, irrespective of the kernel
being executed. The second constraint is the maximum workgroup size a
kernel supports, and can only be queried at runtime once a kernel has
been compiled. The selection of workgroup size for stencil skeletons
is particularly relevant to the performance of the stencil as it
affects utilisation of fast local memory. In a stencil code, each
work-item reads the values of multiple neighbouring elements. To
facilitate this, the value of all elements within a workgroup are
stored in fast local memory, which greatly reduces the read latency
for GPUs. Changing the workgroup size affects the amount of local
memory required for each workgroup, which in turn affects the number
of workgroups which may be simultaneously active.

Tables~\ref{tab:hw},~\ref{tab:kernels}, and~\ref{tab:datasets} list
the range of execution devices, kernels, and datasets used. For each
unique combination of architecture, kernel, and dataset (hereby
referred to as a \emph{scenario}), training data was collected by
randomly sampling the space of legal workgroup sizes, until multiple
samples have been collected for each combination of scenario and
workgroup size.

\subsection{Oracle performance}
For a given scenario $s$ and workgroup size $w$, the arithmetic mean
of measured runtimes if $t(s,w)$. From the set of all scenarios $S$
and workgroup sizes $W$, the subset of workgroup scenarios
$W_{legal}(S) \subset W$ which are legal for a given scenario can be
found using:

\[ W_{legal}(s) = \left\{w | w \in W, w < W_{max}(s) \right\} \]

The arithmetic mean of the measured runtimes for a given scenario $s$
and workgroup size $w$ is represented by $t(s,w)$. The oracle
workgroup size $\Omega(s) \in W_{legal}(s)$ is the $w$ value which
minimises the value of $t(s,w)$:

\[\Omega(s) = \argmin_{w \in W} t(s,w) \]

This allows relative comparisons of performance of $w$ values against
the oracle:

\[ p(s,w) = \frac{t(s,\Omega(s))}{t(s,w)} \]

Where the performance is within the range $0 \le p(s,w) \le 1$. For a
given workgroup size, the average performance $\bar{p}(w)$ can be
found using the geometric mean of performance relative to the oracle
across all scenarios:

\[ \bar{p}(w) = \left(\prod_{s \in S} t(s,\Omega(s)) \cdot t(s,w)^{-1} \right)^{1/|S|} \]

\subsection{Autotuning using classification}
The simplest autotuner is one which selects the workgroup size which
is most commonly optimal (i.e. the mode of all optimal workgroup sizes
$\left\{ \Omega(s) | s \in S \right\}$):

\[ \text{ZeroR} = \text{mode}( \left\{ \Omega(s) | s \in S \right\} ) \]

However, this is not satisfactory for the purpose of selecting a
workgroup size to use, due to the constraint $W_{max}(s)$ enforced for
each scenario. As a result, we propose a so called ``OneR''
classifier, which first defines $W_{safe} \in W$ as the intersection
of legal workgroup sizes across all scenarios, then selects the
workgroup size $w$ which maximises the average performance
$\bar{p}(w)$ across this reduced parameter space.

\[W_{safe} = \cap \left\{ f(s) | s \in S \right\} \]
\[ \text{OneR} = \argmax_{w \in W_{safe}} \bar{p}(w) \]

This provides a baseline for comparing against a more sophisticated
autotuning approaches using machine learning.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}

For each scenario, a feature vector is extracted to capture properties
of the architecture, device, and dataset:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Architectural features} --- size of local memory, maximum
  work group size, number of compute units, etc. Accessed using the
  OpenCL \texttt{clGetDeviceInfo()} API.
\item \emph{Kernel features} --- total static instruction count, ratio
  of instructions per type, ratio of basic blocks per instruction,
  etc. Accessed by compiling the OpenCL kernel to LLVM IR bitcode, and
  using the \texttt{opt} \texttt{InstCount} statistics pass.
\item \emph{Dataset features} --- size and type of the
  dataset. Accessed from the SkelCL Matrix container type.
\end{itemize}

See Appendix~\ref{app:features} for a full list of features and
types. For training, feature vectors are labelled with the oracle
workgroup size, and a classifier is trained on a subset of this
labelled training data. The performance of the classifier is evaluated
by comparing the performance of the workgroup size predicted for an
unseen feature vector against the oracle workgroup size for that
feature.

\subsubsection{Satisfying the maximum workgroup size constraint}

Since classifiers are probabilistic systems, it is possible that a
classifier will predict a workgroup size that is invalid for the given
scenario, $w \not\in W_{legal}(s)$. In these cases, one of three
fallback strategies is used to select a safe workgroup size:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{OneR} --- select the workgroup size which is known to be
  safe and provides the highest average case performance.
\item \emph{Random} --- select a random workgroup size uniformly from
  the set of legal values $w \in W_{legal}$.
\item \emph{Reshape} --- attempt to scale predicted the predicted
  workgroup size proportionally so that it fits within the space of
  legal workgroup sizes.
\end{enumerate}

The evaluation compares the average performance achieved using each
fallback strategy, along with the percentage of cases for which these
fallback strategies were required.

\section{Results}

A total of \input{gen/num_scenarios} scenarios were tested. For each
scenario, an average of \input{gen/num_avg_params} unique workgroup
sizes were tested (max \input{gen/num_max_params}), for a total of
\input{gen/num_runtime_stats} combinations of scenario and workgroup
size. For each of those, an average of \input{gen/num_avg_samples}
runtimes were collected (total
\input{gen/num_runtimes}). Figure~\ref{fig:max-wgsizes} shows the
distribution of maximum workgroup sizes across all
scenarios.

Figure~\ref{fig:oracle-wgsizes} shows the distribution of oracle
workgroup sizes. Clearly, the workgroup size $64 \times 4$ is the
optimal value across the most scenarios, but even that proves optimal
only 10\% of the time. As Figure~\ref{fig:oracle-accuracy} shows, 10
unique workgroup sizes are required in order to achieve oracle
performance just 50\% of the time.
