# 15-06-12 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Evaluate Weka classifiers on OmniTune datasets.

## What I actually did this week

* Wrote visualisation scripts to plot coverage and safety of all
  params. Discovered that I don't yet have a *single* safe param
  value.
* Collected more experimental data to try and address this issue.
* Started brief write-up for Hugh and Pavlos.

## What I will do next week

* Fix the "no safe param" issue.
* Complete implementation of classifier evaluation logic, including
  implementing oner(), rand(), and reshape() error handlers.
* Test ZeroR, J48 and NaiveBayes classifiers against OneR value.
* Complete and submit write-up to supervisors.
* Come up with 3 suggestions for *novel* or innovative work.
* Have supervisor meeting to discuss plans for remaining time.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
