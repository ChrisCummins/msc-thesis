A# 15-06-26 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Begin testing regression for predicting runtimes and relative
  performance of workgroup sizes.
* Incrementally introduce results from synthetic benchmarks, ensuring
  there are still safe params.
* Install on tim and collect experimental data.
* Collect experimental data for *all* devices using FTDT.
* Write-up results and submit to Hugh and Pavlos.

## What I actually did this week

* Installed omnitune on tim and collected experimental data.
* Evaluated ml using GPUs.

## What I will do next week

* Collect experimental data for *all* devices using FTDT.
* Implement an exploration script for CPUs.
* Collect CPU training data.
* Evaluate CPU training data and ensure completeness.
* Implement SQL ML evaluation on GPU data.
* Implement and fully test regression for predicting runtimes on GPU
  data.
* Meet with Hugh and Pavlos to discuss findings.
