# 15-02-06 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Decide on a set of benchmarks to use.
* Write/prepare at least *two* benchmarks from the set.
* Write an iterative compilation script for the map and flags
  parameters.
* Collect some preliminary results.

## What I actually did this week

* Prepared two trivial example programs to begin testing.
* Wrote timing logic for recording isolated times for upload/download
  of data, and kernel execution.

## What I will do next week

* Investigate the relationship between vector size and
  upload/download/exec times for the map skeleton.
* Investigate the effects that varying flags and map partitioning have
  on upload/download/exec times of the map skeleton.
* Take a deep look at Rodinia and attempts to skeletonize it.


## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?

No.
