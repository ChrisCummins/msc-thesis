# 15-03-06 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Write-up SkelCL benchmarks (e.g. what patterns they use, sloccount,
  etc).
* Write experiment scripts to automate collecting performance data of
  SkelCL.
* Investigate benchmarks for SkePU.
* Order a GPU.

## What I actually did this week

* Wrote-up SkelCL benchmarks.
* Refactored 3 benchmarks: CannyEdgeDetection, GameOfLife, FDTD.
* Wrote experimental scripts to automate collecting performance data
  of benchmarks using different run time arguments.
* Defined an experimental methodology `e1` and collected data for the
  3 refactored benchmarks using

## What I will do next week

* Make a list of potentially tunable knobs for SkelCL.
* Prepare SkelCL for an empirical search of the optimisation space
  defined by a selection of said knobs.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes, but not all of the progress has been *useful*. I need to make
sure that the things I set out to do are actually important and
timely.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?

Yes. This has been my most productive week of the year, I just need to
remember to get in on time in the mornings!
