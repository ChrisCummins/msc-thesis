# 15-06-19 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Fix the "no safe param" issue.
* Complete implementation of classifier evaluation logic, including
  implementing oner(), rand(), and reshape() error handlers.
* Test ZeroR, J48 and NaiveBayes classifiers against OneR value.
* Complete and submit write-up to supervisors.
* Come up with 3 suggestions for *novel* or innovative work.
* Have supervisor meeting to discuss plans for remaining time.

## What I actually did this week

* Created joblists of parameters and scenarios for which I don't have
  experimental data.
* Collected results from joblist. This *still* did not seem to work,
  so the "no safe param" issue is still an open problem.
* Created a temporary dataset of only "real" benchmark results.
* Completed implementation of classifier evaluation logic, including
  implementing oner(), rand(), and reshape() error handlers.

## What I will do next week

* Begin testing regression for predicting runtimes and relative
  performance of workgroup sizes.
* Incrementally introduce results from synthetic benchmarks, ensuring
  there are still safe params.
* Install on tim and collect experimental data.
* Collect experimental data for *all* devices using FTDT.
* Write-up results and submit to Hugh and Pavlos.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?

No.
