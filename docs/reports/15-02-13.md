# 15-02-13 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Decide on a set of benchmarks to use.
* Write/prepare at least *two* benchmarks from the set.
* Write an iterative compilation script for the map and flags
  parameters.
* Collect some preliminary results.

## What I actually did this week

* Wrote an iterative compilation script for the map and flags
  parameters.
* Collected preliminary results from this script using a toy-benchmark
  using my desktop. Results showed no useful correlation.
* Wrote a just-for-me report of SkelCL internals.

## What I will do next week

* Get benchmarks and datasets off Michel.
* Look at benchmarks for Intel TBB.
* Email authors of "Locality-Aware Mapping of Nested Parallel Patterns
  on GPUs" about source code for their skeletonised Rodinia.
* Make a start on background reading for Auto-Parallelisation survey
  paper. Make a list of key papers for supervisors.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?

No.
