# 15-05-17 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

## What I actually did this week

* Used static instruction counts generated by LLVM's `InstCount` pass
  to generate kernel features for use with e14.
* Tested e14 using this new set of features (see `eval_e14`),
  demonstrating an average speedup of x2.68 using a decision tree
  classifier.
* Started implementation work on `labm8` library.
* Implement an OmniTune python proxy server which accepts dbus
  requests for workgroup size.
* Implemented runtime safety for workgroup size predictions by
  checking that the recommended workgroup size is smaller than the
  limit enforced by `cl::Kernel`.
* Refactored the `Stencil` and `StencilSequence` classes with help
  from Michel.

## What I will do next week

* Complete slides for PPar conf.
* Create a first draft poster.
* Meet with Hugh and Pavlos to discuss future progress. Should I
  implement the OmniTune server?
* Complete refactoring of `Stencil` and `StencilSequence` and *test*
  on all hw platforms.
* Implement OmniTune proxy HW feature extraction using OpenCL info.
* Implement OmniTune proxy kernel feature extraction using LLVM, and
  results caching.
* Spend an accumulated 5 hours writing my thesis.

## Have I made enough progress this week?
Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
Yes.
