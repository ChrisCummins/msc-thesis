# 15-05-22 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Complete slides for PPar conf.
* Create a first draft poster.
* Meet with Hugh and Pavlos to discuss future progress. Should I
  implement the OmniTune server?
* Complete refactoring of `Stencil` and `StencilSequence` and *test*
  on all hw platforms.
* Implement OmniTune proxy HW feature extraction using OpenCL info.
* Implement OmniTune proxy kernel feature extraction using LLVM, and
  results caching.
* Spend an accumulated 5 hours writing my thesis.

## What I actually did this week

* Completed PPar conf slides and delivered practise presentation.
* Met with Hugh and Pavlos. Discussed the possibility of predicting
  relative performance *or* runtime of kernels, instead of classifying
  optimal workgroup size.
* Completed refactoring or `Stencil`. `StencilSequence` still needs
  testing on multi-device systems.
* Implemented OmniTune proxy HW feature extraction using OpenCL info.
* Implemented OmniTune proxy kernel feature extraction using LLVM
  info.

## What I will do next week

* Complete PPar poster.
* Complete implementation of SQL-backed OmniTune.
* Collect training data from synthetic benchmarks on *all* devices.
* Collect data from example programs on *all* devices.
* Test performance of multiple classifiers at predicting workgroup
  sizes.
* Collate dataset and prepare to meet with Hugh and Pavlos in order to
  present new results of workgroup autotuning.
* Spend a total of 5 hours writing my thesis.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

Yes.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?
