# 15-02-20 Weekly Report

## What I had planned to do this week

* Get benchmarks and datasets off Michel.
* Look at benchmarks for Intel TBB.
* Email authors of "Locality-Aware Mapping of Nested Parallel Patterns
  on GPUs" about source code for their skeletonised Rodinia.
* Make a start on background reading for Auto-Parallelisation survey
  paper. Make a list of key papers for supervisors.

## What I actually did this week

* Was granted access to private SkelCL repo by Michel, which includes
  implementations for: Mandelbrot, Matrix multiply, Gaussian blur,
  Canny edge detection, Sobel edge detection.
* Collected experimental results from Pavlos' server running `testmap`
  benchmark. Similar results to Intel back-end.
* Added SkePU sources to repo and built example programs.

## What I will do next week

MONDAY:
* Read through slides on complexity.
* Copy the 5 SkelCL example programs into `benchmarks`.
* Adjust benchmarks and datasets for medium-length runtimes.
* Write scripts for `benchmarks` to compile and collect runtime data.
* Write-up SkelCL benchmarks (e.g. what patterns they use, sloccount,
  etc).
* Make a list of highly-cited auto-parallelisation papers.
* Organise meeting with Hugh, Pavlos, and Adam.

TUESDAY:
* Complete benchmarks write-up.
* Investigate tunable knobs example SkelCL benchmarks.
* Look up relevant Edinburgh course notes on linear and integer
programming.

WEDNESDAY:
* Investigate porting benchmarks to SkePU.
* Implement tunable knobs for SkelCL and write iterative script.
* Test iterative script on my machine and Pavlos'.

THURSDAY:
* Analyse experimental results from benchmark tests.

## Have I made enough progress this week?

No.

## Have I worked hard enough this week?

No.
