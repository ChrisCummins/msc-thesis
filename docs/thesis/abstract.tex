By their nature, Algorithmic Skeletons abstract implement details from
the user which can be critical to performance. This project explores
the effect of one such implementation detail --- setting the workgroup
size of OpenCL kernels --- for SkelCL Stencil patterns. Through an
exhaustive enumeration of a large optimisation space, we find that
there is no one sensible default value which provides portable
performance across the range of architectures, kernels, and datasets
which SkelCL targets. As a result, we present a machine-learning
enabled autotuner which performs runtime prediction of optimal
workgroup sizes, achieving \fixme{XXX}\% performance of the oracle,
providing an average speedup of \fixme{XXX}$\times$ (max
\fixme{XXX}$\times$) over the best statically chosen value.
