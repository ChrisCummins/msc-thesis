% DEADLINE: 12 NOON, FRIDAY, 21ST AUGUST 2015
%
% The project is only assessed on the basis of a final written
% thesis. Additional material, such as the code you submit, may be taken
% into account in case of doubt, but you should make sure that all the
% work you have done is carefully described in the thesis. Theses will
% typically conform to the following format:
%
% * The length should be 40 -- 70 pages in total and no shorter than 35
%   pages.
%
% * Title page with abstract.
%
% * Introduction: an introduction to the document, clearing stating
%   the hypothesis or objective of the project, motivation for the work
%   and the results achieved. The structure of the remainder of the
%   document should also be outlined.
%
% * Background: background to the project, previous work, exposition of
%   relevant literature, setting of the work in the proper context. This
%   should contain sufficient information to allow the reader to
%   appreciate the contribution you have made.
%
% * Description of the work undertaken: this may be divided into
%   chapters describing the conceptual design work and the actual
%   implementation separately. Any problems or difficulties and the
%   suggested solutions should be mentioned. Alternative solutions and
%   their evaluation should also be included.
%
% * Analysis or Evaluation: results and their critical analysis should
%   be reported, whether the results conform to expectations or
%   otherwise and how they compare with other related work. Where
%   appropriate evaluation of the work against the original objectives
%   should be presented.
%
% * Conclusion: concluding remarks and observations, unsolved problems,
%   suggestions for further work.  Bibliography.
%
% In addition, the thesis must be accompanied by a statement declaring
% that the student has read and understood the University's plagiarism
% guidelines. Students should budget at least six weeks for the final
% thesis writing-up phase. Where appropriate the thesis may additionally
% contain appendices in which relevant program listings, experimental
% data, circuit diagrams, formal proofs, etc. may be included. However,
% students should keep in mind that they are marked on the quality of
% the thesis, not its length. The thesis must be word-processed using
% either LaTeX or a system with similar capabilities. The LaTeX thesis
% template can be found via the local packages web page. You don't have
% to use these packages, but your thesis must match the style (i.e.,
% font size, text width etc) shown in the sample output for an
% Informatics thesis. Technical problems during project work are only
% considered for resources we provide; no technical support,
% compensation for lost data, extensions for time lost due to technical
% problems with external hard- and software as provided will be given,
% except where this is explicitly stated as part of a project
% specification and adequately resourced at the start of the project.
