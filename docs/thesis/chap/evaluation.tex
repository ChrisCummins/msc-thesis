\section{Introduction}

This chapter contains an evaluation of the performance of OmniTune
when tasked with selecting workgroup size of SkelCL stencil codes. The
effectiveness of each of the autotuning techniques described in the
previous chapter are scrutinised and evaluated using multiple
different machine learning algorithms, and the prediction quality is
evaluated for portability across programs, devices, and datasets.
