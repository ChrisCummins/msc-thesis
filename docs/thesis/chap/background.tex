\note{OPTIMISING PROGRAMS FOR GPUs}

Prior research has shown that performance of GPGPU programs are
heavily influenced by proper exploitation of local shared memory and
synchronisation costs~\cite{Ryoo2008a, Lee2010}

% 2008.
\TODO{The challenges and approaches to optimising GPU programs. CUDA
programming requires the developer to explicitly manage data layout in
DRAM, caching, thread communication and other resources. Performance
of such programs depends heavily on fully utilizing zero-overhead
thread scheduling, memory bandwidth, thread grouping, shared control
flow, and intra-block thread communication. The paper gives an example
of optimising matrix multiplication by utilising shared memory through
tiling, and loop unrolling. \cite{Ryoo2008a}}

In~\cite{Lee2010}, \citeauthor{Lee2010} present a performance analysis
of optimised throughput computing applications for GPUs and CPUs. Of
the 14 applications tested, they found GPU performance to be
$0.7\times$-$14.9\times$ that of multi-threaded CPU code, with an
average of only 2.5$\times$. This is much lower than the
$100\times$-$1000\times$ values reported by other studies,

a fact that they attribute to uneven comparison of optimised GPU code
to unoptimised CPU code, or vice versa. \citeauthor{Lee2010} found
that multithreading, cache blocking, reordering of memory accesses and
use of SIMD instructions to contribute most to CPU performance. For
GPUs, the most effective optimisations are reducing synchronization
costs, and exploiting local shared memory. In all cases, the programs
were optimised and hand-tuned by programmers with expert knowledge of
the target architectures. It is unclear whether their performance
results still hold for subsequent generations of devices.

\citeauthor{Dastgeer2011} developed a machine learning based autotuner
for the SkePU skeleton library in~\cite{Dastgeer2011}. Training data
is used to select the optimal backend (i.e.\ CPU, GPU) for a given
program by estimating execution time and memory copy overhead based on
problem size. There is limited cross-architecture evaluation, and the
autotuner only supports vector operations.

\subsection{Autotuning Stencil Codes}

\TODO{In~\cite{Ganapathi2009}, \citeauthor{Ganapathi2009} argues for
  applying statistical machine learning (SML) techniques to develop
  autotuners for multicore software. They present an autotuner for
  Stencil codes which can achieve performance within 1\% or up to 18\%
  better than that of a human expert after 2 hours of running. They
  evaluate the performance of a randomly selected 1500 configurations
  (from a posible 10 million configs), and use Kernel Canonical
  Correlation Analysis (KCCA) to build correlations between tunable
  parameter values and measured performance values. Performance is
  measured using hardware counters (L1 cache misses, TLB misses,
  cycles per thread) and power consumtion in Watts/sec. KCCA seems
  like a strange choice: it scales exponentially with the feature
  vector sizes, and it takes 2 hours (!!!) to build the ML model for
  400 sec worth of benchmark data. They present an interesting
  argument that enegy efficiency should be used as an autotuning
  target as well as just run time, since it was the power wall that
  lead to the multicore revolution in the first place. They explain
  the motivation and results well. I like that they compare their
  results with human expert and hardware upper bound. It is a solid
  paper which makes a compelling argument, but their choice of only 2
  benchmarks and 2 platforms makes the evaluation of their autotuner a
  little limited. Cited by 52.}

\TODO{Kamil presents an auto-tuning framework which accepts as input a
  Fortran 95 stencil expression, and generates tuned parallel
  implementations in Fortan, C, or CUDA. The system uses an IR to
  explore auto-tuning transformations, and has an SMP backend code
  generator. They demonstrate their system on 4 architectures using 3
  benchmarks, with speedups of up to x22 over serial. The CUDA code
  generator only uses global memory (!!). Also, there's no real search
  engine. They randomly enumerate a subset of the optimisation space,
  and then record only a single execution time (!!!), reporting the
  fastest. Cited by 127.~\cite{Kamil2010}}

\subsubsection{PATUS}

\TODO{PATUS consists of a DSL for expressing stencil codes, a C code
  generator, and an autotuner for exploring the optimisation space,
  using blocking and vectorisation strategies. Pro: Supports
  arbitrarily high dimensional grids. They introduce *2* new DSLs
  without comment on why they were needed. This is a huge price of
  entry for anyone who actually wants to *use* PATUS to solve
  problems, and a decision that I think they could have justified
  better. They provide nice and concise explanations of stencil codes
  and the types of optimisation methods used by other autotuners
  (ATLAS, FLAME, FFTW, SPIRAL). However, they *barely* explain their
  own, saying only that they perform *either* an exhaustive, multi-run
  Powell, Nelder Mead, or evolutionary algorithms.  Their evaluation
  uses 6 benchmarks, and 3 architectures. Only 1 of those is a GPU. It
  would have been nice to shown performance across GPU
  architectures. From the perspective of autotuning, the paper comes
  as across quite weak: They do not present an "oracle" performance,
  so we can't compare the quality of their autotuner compared to
  it. They don't show how the optimal tunable parameter values vary
  across results, so they don't demonstrate how autotuning is
  *necessary* (maybe there's one single value which works well for all
  results?). They do not give any indication of convergence time of
  their autotuner. They do not report the number of different
  combinations that their autotuner tries.~\cite{Christen2011}}

\subsubsection{PARTANS}

% for Stencil Computation on Multi-GPU Systems,” ACM
% Trans. Archit. Code Optim., vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 1–24, 2013.
\citeauthor{Lutz2013} explored the effect of varying the size of the
halo regions for multi-GPU stencil computations in~\cite{Lutz2013}. A
large halo increases redundant computation across GPUs but decreases
communication costs. They found that the optimal halo size depends on
the problem size, number of partitions, and the connection mechanism
(i.e.\ PCI express). They developed an autotuner which determines
problem decomposition and swapping strategy offline, and performs an
online search for the optimal halo size. The study is limited to only
three optimisation parameters of a single class of program, and the
results of tuning are not shared across programs or across multiple
runs of the same program.
