of optimised throughput computing applications for GPUs and CPUs. Of
the 14 applications tested, they found GPU performance to be
$0.7\times$-$14.9\times$ that of multi-threaded CPU code, with an
average of only 2.5$\times$. This is much lower than the

a fact that they attribute to uneven comparison of optimised GPU code
to unoptimised CPU code, or vice versa. \citeauthor{Lee2010} found
that multithreading, cache blocking, reordering of memory accesses and
use of SIMD instructions to contribute most to CPU performance. For
GPUs, the most effective optimisations are reducing synchronization
costs, and exploiting local shared memory. In all cases, the programs
were optimised and hand-tuned by programmers with expert knowledge of
the target architectures. It is unclear whether their performance
results still hold for subsequent generations of devices.

\section{High-Level GPU Programming with SkelCL}

Introduced in~\cite{Steuwer2011}, SkelCL is an object oriented C++
library that provides OpenCL implementations of data parallel
algorithmic skeletons for heterogeneous parallelism using CPUs or
multi-GPUs. Skeletons are parameterised with muscle functions by the
user, which are compiled into OpenCL kernels for execution on device
hardware. The Vector and Matrix container types transparently handle
communication between the host and device memory, and support
partitioning for multi-GPU execution.

SkelCL is freely
available\footnote{\url{http://skelcl.uni-muenster.de}} and
distributed under dual GPL and academic licenses.

\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\map\left(f,
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\

\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\zip \left( \oplus,
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\

\end{bmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Reduce}

\reduce \left( \oplus, i,
\begin{bmatrix}

\end{equation}

\subsubsection{AllPairs}

\begin{equation}
\allpairs \left( \oplus,
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1d} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{nd}
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
  y_{11} & \cdots & y_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\

\end{bmatrix} \right)
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
  z_{11} & \cdots & z_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\

\left[ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{id} \right] \oplus
\left[ y_{j1}, y_{j2}, \ldots, y_{jd} \right]
\end{equation}

An additional implementation is provided for when the $\oplus$
operator is known to match that of a zip pattern:

\begin{equation}
z_{ij} =
\left[
  x_{i1}, \oplus y_{j1}, x_{i2} \oplus y_{j2}, \ldots, x_{id} \oplus y_{jd}
\right]
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Stencil}

\TODO{Define border region (sometimes referred to as halo region).}

Stencils are patterns of computation which operate on uniform grids of
data, where the value of each cell is updated based on its current
value and the value of one or more neighbouring elements, called the
border region. In SkelCL, a 2D stencil skeleton allows users to
provide a function which updates a cell's value, and SkelCL
orchestrates the parallel execution of this function across all
cells. Each cell maps to a single work item; and this collection of
work items is then divided into \emph{workgroups} for execution on the
target hardware.

In SkelCL, the border region is described by a \emph{stencil shape},
which defines an $i \times j$ rectangular region about each cell which
is used to update the cell value. Stencil shapes may be asymmetrical,
and a defined in terms of the number of cells in the border region to
the north, east, south, and west of each cell, shown in
Figure~\xref{\TODO{Diagram of 3 stencil shapes.}}

Given a customising function $f$, a stencil shape $S$, and an
$n \times m$ matrix:

\begin{equation}
\stencil \left( f, S,
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{nm}
\end{bmatrix} \right)
\to
\begin{bmatrix}
  z_{11} & \cdots & z_{1m} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  z_{n1} & \cdots & z_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
z_{ij} = f \left(
\begin{bmatrix}
  z_{i-S_n,j-S_w} & \cdots & z_{i-S_n,j+S_e} \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  z_{i+S_s,j-S_w} & \cdots & z_{i+S_s,j+S_e}
\end{bmatrix} \right)
\end{equation}

A popular application of Stencil codes is for iterative problems, in
which \todo{\ldots} discrete time steps $0 <= t <= t_{max}$, and
$t \in \mathbb{Z}$

\begin{equation}
g(f, S, M, t) =
\begin{cases}
  \stencil \left( f, S, g(f, S, M, t-1) \right),& \text{if } t \geq 1\\
  M_{init}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

A Stencil operation in which the size of the stencil shape $S$ is zero
in every direction is functionally equivalent to a Map operation.

\subsubsection{Data distributions}

\TODO{Description and diagrams for single, block, copy, and overlap

\subsection{Implementation Details}

Each skeleton is represented by a template class, declared in a header
file detailing the public API. A private header file contains the
template definition. E.g. \texttt{SkelCL/Map.h} contains the Map
class, and \texttt{SkelCL/detail/MapDef.h} contains the
implementation. Non-trivial kernels are stored in separate source
files, e.g. \texttt{SkelCL/detail/MapKernel.cl}.

\subsection{Example Application}

}


\subsection{Workgroup size and Stencil Codes}

% TODO:

In OpenCL, kernels are mapped to work-items for execution on the
processing units of GPUs and CPUs. These work-items are then grouped
into one or more workgroups. The choice of workgroup size is left to
the developer, but with two sets of constraints. The first set of
constraints is the maximum workgroup size which an execution device
supports. This value cannot be exceeded, irrespective of the kernel
being executed. The second constraint is the maximum workgroup size a
kernel supports, and can only be queried at runtime once a kernel has
been compiled. The selection of workgroup size for stencil skeletons
is particularly relevant to the performance of the stencil as it
affects utilisation of fast local memory. In a stencil code, each
work-item reads the values of multiple neighbouring elements. To
facilitate this, the value of all elements within a workgroup are
stored in fast local memory, which greatly reduces the read latency
for GPUs. Changing the workgroup size affects the amount of local
memory required for each workgroup, which in turn affects the number
of workgroups which may be simultaneously active. \TODO{Explain (or
  rephrase) why this isn't a curve that gets better as the memory size
  goes up until a threshold after which it falls off. Would binary
  search work?}

\TODO{%
  While the user is clearly in control of the type of work which is
  executed, the size of the grid, and the size of the border region,
  it is very much the responsibility of the skeleton implementation to
  select what workgroup size to use. As such I designed an experiment
  to explore just what effect changing workgroup sizes has on the
  performance of Stencil skeletons.%
