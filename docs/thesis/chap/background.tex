In~\cite{Lee2010}, \citeauthor{Lee2010} present a performance analysis
of optimised throughput computing applications for GPUs and CPUs. Of
the 14 applications tested, they found GPU performance to be
$0.7\times$-$14.9\times$ that of multi-threaded CPU code, with an
average of only 2.5$\times$. This is much lower than the
$100\times$-$1000\times$ values reported by other studies,

a fact that they attribute to uneven comparison of optimised GPU code
to unoptimised CPU code, or vice versa. \citeauthor{Lee2010} found
that multithreading, cache blocking, reordering of memory accesses and
use of SIMD instructions to contribute most to CPU performance. For
GPUs, the most effective optimisations are reducing synchronization
costs, and exploiting local shared memory. In all cases, the programs
were optimised and hand-tuned by programmers with expert knowledge of
the target architectures. It is unclear whether their performance
results still hold for subsequent generations of devices.

\TODO{Portability of OpenCL kernels: \cite{Rul2010}}

\subsubsection{Problem decomposition and workgroups}

In OpenCL, kernels are mapped to work-items for execution on the
processing units of GPUs and CPUs. These work-items are then grouped
into one or more workgroups. The choice of workgroup size is left to
the developer, but with two sets of constraints. The first set of
constraints is the maximum workgroup size which an execution device
supports. This value cannot be exceeded, irrespective of the kernel
being executed. The second constraint is the maximum workgroup size a
kernel supports, and can only be queried at runtime once a kernel has
been compiled. The selection of workgroup size for stencil skeletons
is particularly relevant to the performance of the stencil as it
affects utilisation of fast local memory. In a stencil code, each
work-item reads the values of multiple neighbouring elements. To
facilitate this, the value of all elements within a workgroup are
stored in fast local memory, which greatly reduces the read latency
for GPUs. Changing the workgroup size affects the amount of local
memory required for each workgroup, which in turn affects the number
of workgroups which may be simultaneously active.
