\TODO{Show performance visualisations for the same program and dataset
  on 3 different architectures (2 GPUs, 1 CPU). Show how performance
  isn't portable across devices.}

\TODO{Show visualisations of performance for different stencils in
  CannyEdgeDetection. Demonstrate that application-level tuning isn't
  granular enough.}

\TODO{Show how performance changes with dataset size / type.}
