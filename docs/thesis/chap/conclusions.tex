% TODO: Extensions to SkelCL: Cluster parallelism, multi-dimensional
% stencils, stencil specialisations for specific memory access
% patterns.

% TODO: Additional optimisation parameters, e.g. which device to
% execute on.

% TODO: Apply to additional skeleton libraries.

% TODO: energy as an optimisation cotarget.

  Consider using adaptive sampling plans and some sort of global
  mechanism for performing cooperative exploration across multiple
  devices, while reducing the number of samples required to
  distinguish good from bad workgroup sizes~\cite{Leather2009}.%
