\section{Code Generation and Autotuning of Stencil Codes}

\TODO{Intro to section: autotuning of stencil codes\ldots}

% Y. Zhang and F. Mueller, “Auto-generation and Auto-tuning of 3D
% Stencil Codes on GPU clusters,” in Proceedings of the Tenth
% International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization, 2012,
% pp. 155–164.
In~\cite{Zhang2013a}, \citeauthor{Zhang2013a} present a code generator
and autotuner for 3D Jacobi stencil codes. Using a DSL to express
kernel functions, the code generator performs substitution from one of
two CUDA templates to create programs for execution on GPUs. GPU
programs are parameterised and tuned for block size, block dimensions,
and whether input data is stored in read only texture memory. This
creates an optimisation space of up to 200 configurations.

In an evaluation of 4 benchmarks, the authors report impressive
performance that is comparable with previous implementations of
iterative Jacobi stencils on
GPUs~\cite{Holewinski2012,Phillips2010}. The dominating parameter is
shown to be block dimensions, followed by block size, then read only
memory.

% FIXME: This section isn't really relevant.
An unfortunate limitation of their system is that they do not support
multi-GPU execution within a single node, instead using message
passing in a cluster. This rules out the possible benefits of
performing loop compaction across stencil iterations, an optimisation
which has shown to be beneficial for multi-GPU performance
in~\cite{Lutz2013}.

The DSL presented in the paper is limited to expressing only Jacobi
Stencils applications. Critically, their autotuner requires a full
enumeration of the parameter space for each program. Since there is no
indication of the compute time required to gather this data, it gives
the impression that the system would be impractical for the needs of
general purpose stencil computing. The autotuner presented in this
thesis overcomes this drawback by learning parameter values which
transfer to unseen stencils, without the need for an expensive tuning
phase for each program and architecture.
% TODO: Depending on results of cross-architecture validation, this
% last claim may not hold up.

% The majority of applications tested are memory bound. Does this
% transfer to computer bound?

In~\cite{Ganapathi2009}, \citeauthor{Ganapathi2009} argues for
applying statistical machine learning (SML) techniques to develop
autotuners for multicore software. They present an autotuner for
Stencil codes which can achieve performance within 1\% or up to 18\%
better than that of a human expert after 2 hours of running. They
evaluate the performance of a randomly selected 1500 configurations
(from a posible 10 million configs), and use Kernel Canonical
Correlation Analysis (KCCA) to build correlations between tunable
parameter values and measured performance values. Performance is
measured using hardware counters (L1 cache misses, TLB misses, cycles
per thread) and power consumtion in Watts/sec. KCCA seems like a
strange choice: it scales exponentially with the feature vector sizes,
and it takes 2 hours (!!!) to build the ML model for 400 sec worth of
benchmark data. They present an interesting argument that enegy
efficiency should be used as an autotuning target as well as just run
time, since it was the power wall that lead to the multicore
revolution in the first place. They explain the motivation and results
well. I like that they compare their results with human expert and
hardware upper bound. It is a solid paper which makes a compelling
argument, but their choice of only 2 benchmarks and 2 platforms makes
the evaluation of their autotuner a little limited.

\citeauthor{Kamil2010} presents an auto-tuning framework which accepts as input a
Fortran 95 stencil expression, and generates tuned parallel
implementations in Fortan, C, or CUDA. The system uses an IR to
explore auto-tuning transformations, and has an SMP backend code
generator. They demonstrate their system on 4 architectures using 3
benchmarks, with speedups of up to x22 over serial. The CUDA code
generator only uses global memory (!!). Also, there's no real search
engine. They randomly enumerate a subset of the optimisation space,
and then record only a single execution time (!!!), reporting the
fastest. Cited by 127.~\cite{Kamil2010}

\paragraph{PATUS} In~\cite{Christen2011}, \citeauthor{Christen2011}
presents a DSL for expressing stencil codes, a C code generator, and
an autotuner for exploring the optimisation space, using blocking and
vectorisation strategies. Pro: Supports arbitrarily high dimensional
grids. They introduce *2* new DSLs without comment on why they were
needed. This is a huge price of entry for anyone who actually wants to
*use* PATUS to solve problems, and a decision that I think they could
have justified better. They provide nice and concise explanations of
stencil codes and the types of optimisation methods used by other
autotuners (ATLAS, FLAME, FFTW, SPIRAL). However, they *barely*
explain their own, saying only that they perform *either* an
exhaustive, multi-run Powell, Nelder Mead, or evolutionary algorithms.
Their evaluation uses 6 benchmarks, and 3 architectures. Only 1 of
those is a GPU. It would have been nice to shown performance across
GPU architectures. From the perspective of autotuning, the paper comes
as across quite weak: They do not present an "oracle" performance, so
we can't compare the quality of their autotuner compared to it. They
don't show how the optimal tunable parameter values vary across
results, so they don't demonstrate how autotuning is *necessary*
(maybe there's one single value which works well for all
results?). They do not give any indication of convergence time of
their autotuner. They do not report the number of different
combinations that their autotuner tries.

\paragraph{PARTANS} A stencil grid can be decomposed into smaller
subsections so that multiple GPUs can operate on each subsection
independently. This requires a small overlapping region where each
subsection meets --- the halo region --- to be shared between
devices. For iterative stencils, values in the halo region must be
synchronised between devices after each iteration, leading to costly
communication overheads. One possible optimisation is to deliberately
increase the size of the halo region, allowing each device to compute
updated values for the halo region, instead of requiring a
synchronisation of shared state. This reduces the communication costs
between GPUs, at the expense of introducing redundant computation.

Tuning the size of this halo region is the subject of PARTANS
\cite{Lutz2013}, an autotuning framework for multi-GPU stencil
computations. \citeauthor{Lutz2013} explored the effect of varying the
size of the halo regions using 6 benchmark applications, finding that
the optimal halo size depends on the size of the grid, the number of
partitions, and the connection mechanism (i.e.\ PCI express). They
developed an autotuner which determines problem decomposition and
swapping strategy offline, and performs an online search for the
optimal halo size. \TODO{Extra details about autotuner} The results of
tuning are not shared across programs or across multiple runs of the
same program.
