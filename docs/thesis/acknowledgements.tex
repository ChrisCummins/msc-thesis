I would like to sincerely thank supervisors Hugh Leather and Pavlos
Petoumenos for their excellent guidance, for suffering through early
revisions of this work, and for making the beginning of my
metamorphosis from fledgling undergraduate to cynical postgraduate an
utter joy. My thanks to Michel Steuwer for his patient and
enthusiastic expositions of the SkelCL internals, and to Murray Cole
and the CDT staff for creating this great environment for
learning. Finally, thank you to my fellow PPar colleagues who share my
love of strong coffee and weak humour.
