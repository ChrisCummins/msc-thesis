To build the sources, run the following commands from this directory:

```
./autogen.sh; ./configure; make
```

The configure script will attempt to adapt to your local build
environment and determine what can and cannot be built with the tools
available. Take a look at the output of `./configure` to see if
anything useful is being missed.
